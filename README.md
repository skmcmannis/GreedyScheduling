# Greedy Scheduling

Schedules activities supplied via an input file (act.txt), and outputs the scheduled activities to the terminal. Uses a greedy algorithm to select the activity that is last to start from the activities remaining to be scheduled.

Input file is organized as follows:

First line: number of activities in the group to follow

Next lines: activities, with the number of the activity, start time, and end time

...repeated for each test case
